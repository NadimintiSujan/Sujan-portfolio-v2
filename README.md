# Sujan Portfolio

This is the second iteration of my React portfolio, rebuilt with a split-panel layout, scroll-snapping sections, and a dedicated project archive.

## Highlights

- Hero + bio, education timeline, and detailed experience cards.
- Responsive layout tuned for large screens and phones (sticky nav on desktop, stacked layout on mobile).
- Project grid with tags plus a chronological archive view.
- Custom cursor spotlight, reveal animations, and downloadable resume link.

## Tech Stack

- React + Hooks
- CSS (no frameworks) with custom animations and responsive breakpoints
- React Icons
